# Copilot Instructions – OpenClaw Android Companion

You are building a **real Android node**, not a demo.

When generating code:
- Prefer failure over silence
- Implement logs before UI
- Never invent server endpoints
- Never simulate success

Required outputs:
- ForegroundService implementations
- WebSocket gateway with heartbeat
- Permission-aware CameraX usage
- Persistent storage for node identity

If execution cannot be proven, mark the feature as FAILED.
