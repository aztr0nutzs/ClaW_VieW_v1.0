# Phone-Only Receipts Guide (OpenClaw Android Companion)

If you are building from a phone browser, you will NOT have adb logcat. So receipts must be generated by the app.

## Where receipts must go
Store exports under:
- `OpenClaw/receipts/` (app-accessible storage)

Minimum structure:
- `OpenClaw/receipts/phase0_logs.txt`
- `OpenClaw/receipts/phase0_device.json`
- `OpenClaw/receipts/phase1_node.json`
- `OpenClaw/receipts/phase1_logs.txt`
- `OpenClaw/receipts/phase2/handshake.jsonl`

## What to do when Codex blocks
If Codex says “missing logcat/screenshots,” respond:
1) Implement/verify the in-app Receipts screen exists in openclaw_dash.html
2) Export receipts for the requested phase
3) Attach the exported files (or paste file contents) back into the PR description

## What “proof” looks like (minimum)
### Phase 0 proof
- logs file contains GUI_LOADED + SERVICE_START + START_FOREGROUND

### Phase 1 proof
- node.json contains nodeId
- logs show same nodeId across 2 launches

### Phase 2 proof
- handshake.jsonl exists even if it shows failure
- contains TX connect attempt + RX close reason/code
